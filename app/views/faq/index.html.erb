                        	SmartPlate is equipped with 3 mini-cameras (e.g. like the ones currently used in smartphones) and uses advanced object recognition to identify everything sitting on its surface. It also comes with super accurate weight sensors which enable it to weigh up to three pounds of food at once. It then combines both the image and the weight, and sends this information to the USDA's database of over 8,000 household foods (plus another database where we host over 300,000 sku's and over 100,000 restaurant meals) for analysis. It does all this in less than a few seconds.

                        	Our algorithms are currently being trained to read things like mixed salads, rice pilaf, spaggetti with sauce and meatballs. In fact, she (she's a she: ) already knows the difference between white pasta with sauce and whole wheat pasta with sauce! 
It will also get smarter over time as more people start to use it, it'll start learning the subtle nuances between more complex mixes of food.
Also, in the case where she is uncertain of what it sees, she will take an educated guess and will give you options to select from if she is incorrect This approach will help her get smarter and you will play a major role in helping us build the largest food database on the planet - for the planet.

It is designed with non-stick, BPA free, and heat resistant plastic that can easily be rinsed, and air dried right on its water resistant charger, which sits next to your sink. This makes it easy for you to reuse the SmartPlate each time you walk in the kitchen : )

                        	SmartPlate comes with an accompanying Android or iOS app which uses the same food recognition technology as the plate. However, it will not be as accurate as the plate due to the absence of the load sensors. This solution will be reasonably effective for anyone who eats out up to 5X per week. Just open the SmartPlate app, snap a picture of your dinner or lunch, and we'll match your meal to over 100,000 restaurant dishes currently in our database. Easy peasy!
